    <h2>About Jeff Kraft</h2>
    <Polaroid src={imgJeffHeadshot} alt="Photo of Jeff Kratz, framed by a breezy window" />
    <p>Under its surface, as the great writer Honor√© de Balzac noted, there are always new discoveries‚Äîplaces, scents, tastes, colors‚Äîthat captivate and renew all our senses.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve made 30+ personal and professional trips there and, as Ernest Hemingway wrote, was lucky enough to have lived there as a young man. Wherever I‚Äôve gone in my life, Paris has indeed stayed with me. Far from my central Illinois origins. (I currently live in Washington DC with my wife Frances, who hails from Florida and enjoys Paris as much as I do: in fact, we were married there.)</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve been a college French professor for more than a decade, teaching college students not only the language but also literature, history and culture. It‚Äôs been a full-circle moment since my first job after college in the 1980s was teaching English at a Paris <em>lyc√©e</em> on a Fulbright program. That led to earning my Master‚Äôs in journalism from the Universit√© de Paris II (Panth√©on-Assas) and a long career in international marketing.</p>
    <p>For this next chapter, I am committed to teaching and guiding fellow French nerds‚ÄîOK, <em>Francophiles</em>‚Äîalong the splendid boulevards, bridges, gardens and narrow passageways that I‚Äôve gotten to know so well (yet still surprise me). What will make your trip so much more than mere travel is that you‚Äôll study French lifestyle, literature and language in mini courses <em>before</em> we travel. Once there, you‚Äôll live and travel like a local, immersed in a central base of the city, and will balance guided explorations along with your own interests and discoveries. I‚Äôll be there as a resource every step of the way.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm also the author and photographer of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Literary-Paris-Jeffrey-Kraft/dp/0823028305"><em>Literary Paris</em></a>, in which I‚Äôve paired my black-and-white Paris photography with excerpts and inspiring quotes from the great writers who made Paris timeless. I‚Äôll be excited to work with you as a photographer and editor to produce a coffee table book of your journey‚Äîone that celebrates why Paris and France are important <em>to you</em>.</p>
