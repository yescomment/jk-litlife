      <p><strong>Format:</strong> 4 one-hour Zoom sessions</p>
      <p>Hemingway’s memoir sets the world to dreaming, and Paris of the 1920s springs to life in this slim volume published after the author’s 1961 death. We’ll read the book, but also take in movies, texts and articles that provide a richer background for fully savoring Ernest’s Paris in ways that “will stay with you, wherever you go.”</p>
