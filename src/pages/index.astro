    <a class="button" href="/biography">Read full bio</a>
    <p>“PGO” is a fun way of saying I’m an easygoing teacher and guide. I’ve lived in, worked in and traveled to France more than 30 times. I have been teaching college-level French language and culture for over a decade. I’m also the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Literary-Paris-Jeffrey-Kraft/dp/0823028305"><em>Literary Paris</em></a>, a book of photography and travel essays.</p>

    <p>LitLifeFrance is my next chapter: sharing my love and expertise to small groups online, then traveling to France together for unforgettable, one-week <em>séjours</em> (journeys).</p>

      <p>Hemingway’s memoir sets the world to dreaming, and Paris of the 1920s springs to life in this slim volume published after the author’s 1961 death. We’ll read the book, but also take in movies, texts and articles that provide a richer background for fully savoring Ernest’s Paris in ways that “will stay with you, wherever you go.”</p>

      <p>Yeah, you’ve said you were going to do this for years. Why will this time be different? And why are more age 50+ folks doing so? This will give you the impetus, immersion tools, practice and practical vocabulary you’ll need to dust off your French and move toward A2 level (‘basic user,’ required for immigration) language competency—whether greeting, wayfinding, or buying your daily baguette.</p>

    <p>$95 includes a reading list for a four-session course, professor-guided instructions, and writing guidance/editing of your reflections.</p>

      <summary class="infobox"><strong>Octobre 2024:</strong> Paris Saint-Germain</summary>
      <p><strong>Arrivée:</strong> samedi 5 octobre 2024</p>
      <p><strong>Départ:</strong> samedi 12 octobre 2024</p>
      <p>Join me in Paris’ glittering Left Bank district, for a full week of discoveries as trees turn full color and chestnuts fall. We’ll step off with an early Sunday morning river walk, past the restored Notre-Dame cathedral and into the Luxembourg Gardens through farmers markets en route to a fantastic lunch and neighborhood orientation. Monday will blend offbeat museums and select shopping as we widen our circle to include the Marais quarter. We keep our eyes on the skies for the best possible weather days for side trips to Monet’s Giverny gardens, exploding with dahlias and nasturtium, and Fontainebleau Palace, gilded by eight centuries of French history. We’ll catch buses, trains, even a few bike rides, while balancing an elegant Paris whirl of activity: a chef’s private dining room, unique bakeries and pastry shops, aperitifs with a local author talk, a night at the theater, a morning of flea market finds, plus visits to some of the best current exhibits at Paris museums.</p>

    <p>All séjours are seven days in duration, kick off on Sundays, and will be anchored in one neighborhood you’ll call home. You will find my leadership style to be easygoing, curious and encouraging.</p>
    <p>Each journey will be about 50/50 planned vs. free time, and tailored to each group’s interests. I start by orienting you to our neighborhood, so you feel as if you live there. Then we’ll meet most days for one overall 2-6 hour walking excursion – a non-touristy blend of museums, gardens, theater, or shopping using public transportation—related to what we’ve studied and discussed. It’s an immersive, authentic journey.</p>
    <p>$2000 pp includes 2 mini courses, private consultations prior to your travel, custom itinerary , dedicated on-the-ground guide, and a coffee-table book of your experience post-trip. You save by booking your own airfare and accommodations. On the ground, you’ll also buy most meals and your local travel.</p>
    <p>LitLifeFrance lets you cultivate your love of and in-depth knowledge of all things French. <em>With</em> a trusted guide and a community to support you. And <em>without</em> having to speak the language—unless you want to!</p>
