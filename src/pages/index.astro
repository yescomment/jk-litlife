    <p>“<em>PGO</em>” is a fun way of saying I’m an easygoing teacher and guide. I’ve lived in, worked in and traveled to France more than 30 times. I have been teaching college-level French language and culture for over a decade. I’m also the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Literary-Paris-Jeffrey-Kraft/dp/0823028305"><em>Literary Paris</em></a>, a book of photography and travel essays.</p>
    <p>LitLifeFrance offers new ways for you to enjoy all things French. Enjoy 'insider access' to the culture and the country as you prepare to enjoy and celebrate unforgettable, one-week travel experiences!</p>
