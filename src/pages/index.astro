    <h2>Travel With Me To France</h2>

      <summary class="infobox"><strong>Octobre 2024:</strong> Paris Saint-Germain</summary>
      <p><strong>Arriv√©e:</strong> samedi 5 octobre 2024</p>
      <p><strong>D√©part:</strong> samedi 12 octobre 2024</p>
      <p>Join me in Paris‚Äô glittering Left Bank district, for a full week of discoveries as trees turn full color and chestnuts fall. We‚Äôll step off with an early Sunday morning river walk, past the restored Notre-Dame cathedral and into the Luxembourg Gardens through farmers markets en route to a fantastic lunch and neighborhood orientation. Monday will blend offbeat museums and select shopping as we widen our circle to include the Marais quarter. We keep our eyes on the skies for the best possible weather days for side trips to Monet‚Äôs Giverny gardens, exploding with dahlias and nasturtium, and Fontainebleau Palace, gilded by eight centuries of French history. We‚Äôll catch buses, trains, even a few bike rides, while balancing an elegant Paris whirl of activity: a chef‚Äôs private dining room, unique bakeries and pastry shops, aperitifs with a local author talk, a night at the theater, a morning of flea market finds, plus visits to some of the best current exhibits at Paris museums.</p>

    <p>All s√©jours are seven days in duration, kick off on Sundays, and will be anchored in one neighborhood you‚Äôll call home.</p>

    <h4>Here are the three steps for how each journey works:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>I pick travel dates</strong>, a Paris neighborhood where everyone will stay, and set an overall itinerary based on what will be happening in the city in the season we go.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>You book and pay for your flights and accommodations</strong>, with an assist from me to ensure you‚Äôre within a 15-minute walk of my home base.</p>
        <p>Then you participate in more fun reading and online discussions as mini-courses adapted from the French culture and language classes I teach college students.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>After getting to know one another online, we then meet up</strong> for a week of living and exploring, together and independently, in a fascinating place.</p>
        <p>I always start by orienting you to our neighborhood, so you feel as if you live there. Then we meet up most days and explore. Avoiding cookie-cutter tour stops. Not in an exhausting way. (Think garden walks, flea markets, fun detours, great meals, insider shopping, nights at the theatre. Taking buses and subways like locals. Plus time on your own to explore, work out, sleep in, sip, savor.)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Every journey will be unique, and designed to inspire and illuminate. And you won‚Äôt feel as if you‚Äôre part of a crowd: each travel ‚Äòcohort‚Äô will be no larger than 6 people. You‚Äôll also have time to explore on your own: we‚Äôll work toward a 50/50 balance of planned vs. free time, with an itinerary tailored to each group‚Äôs interests as well as what‚Äôs going on about town in the time period we‚Äôll be visiting.</p>
    <p>$3500 pp includes 2 mini courses, private consultations prior to your travel, custom itinerary, my on-the-ground guidance, a welcome dinner, farewell cocktail hour, and a colorful, coffee-table book of your experience post-trip. You save by booking your own airfare and accommodations. On the ground, you‚Äôll also buy most meals and your local travel.</p>
    <p class="center">¬∂</p>
    <p>LitLifeFrance lets you cultivate your love of and in-depth knowledge of all things French. <em>With</em> a trusted guide and a community to support you. And <em>without</em> having to speak the language‚Äîunless you want to!</p>
