    <h2>Meet Jeff Kraft, your <em>Professeur & Gentil Organisateur</em></h2>
    <p>“PGO” is a fun way of saying I’ll be your easygoing teacher and guide. I’ve lived in, worked in and traveled to France more than 30 times. I have been teaching college-level French language and culture for over a decade. I’m also the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Literary-Paris-Jeffrey-Kraft/dp/0823028305"><em>Literary Paris</em></a>, a book of photography and travel essays.</p>
    <p>LitLifeFrance is my next chapter: sharing my love and expertise to small groups online, then traveling to France together for unforgettable, one-week <em>séjours</em> (journeys)..</p>

    <h2>The Mini Courses</h2>
    <p class="infobox">Courses begin <strong>May 2024</strong></p>
    <p>Begin your French refresh with a mini course. These aren’t your average French class: I’ve adapted the best parts of my undergraduate courses – organized into small bites by literature, language or lifestyle—for everyday learners. With an emphasis on book-group style discussion, courses also let me get to know you and help build our community of fellow French nerds. While courses are aligned to a tailored 7-day Paris experience, you are <strong>not</strong> commiting to travel by enrolling. There will be plenty of time to decide if you want to join a journey.</p>

    <p>Interested? <a href="https://unitof.typeform.com/to/xUAD6RM2" class="button">Tell me more about yourself.</a></p>

    <p>$350 includes a reading list for a four-session course, professor-guided instructions, and writing guidance/editing of your reflections.</p>
