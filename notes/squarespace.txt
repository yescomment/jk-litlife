Enjoy Authentic Paris   

“ Paris is an ocean. However you explore it, you still will never know its depths.”

B A L Z A C
LitLife is a new way to  open the doors to all that’s French.
Widen your perspective as part of an online community where we read, reflect and discuss before digging deep, tasting, sipping, and walking (a lot) through history and contemporary culture.
TEST YOUR FRANCE I.Q.
Illuminating
Don’t we all deserve a more inspired life? 

LitLife lets you explore French literature and culture in a fun online course format, taught in English, before you actually visit France as a small group—with your professor as your in-person guide.

Courses are aligned to a tailored 7-day Paris experience, one where you’ll know the “in” places of your quartier, enjoy the night at the Comédie-Française, and confidently faire la queue to buy your daily bread.    

You’ll join a community for people age 50+ who enjoy lifelong learning and authentic travel throughout France and Europe.

Meet Your PGO*
Jeff Kraft
*Professeur, Gentil-Organisateur

PGO is a fun way of saying I’ll be your teacher and guide. I’ve been to France more than 30 times and have taught college-level French language, literature and culture courses for more than a decade. I’m the author of the photo book Literary Paris.

“The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.”
